# Data Structures
This repo consists of the different implementations for common data structures
- Stack
- Queue
- Linked List
___

## Stack
A linear data structure where all the insertion and deletion of data are only performed at one end. Stacks can be implemented by using linear arrays and carry the Last In-First Out principle as shown in the diagram below:

## Queue
A linear data structure that is used to represent a linear list. Queues allow for the insertion of an element (enqueue) to be performed at one end and deletion of an element (dequeue) at the other end. It follows the First In-First Out principle as represented in the diagram.

## LinkedList
A linear data structure where the elements are **not stored** at contiguous memory locations. Elements in a linked list are referred to as _nodes_. They carry a data field and a pointer which references and links them to the subsequent element as shown in the diagram:
